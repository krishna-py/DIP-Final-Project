â€”The segmentation of retinal blood vessels in the
retina is a critical step in diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. In this
paper, we present a new method for automatically segmenting
blood vessels in retinal images. Five basic algorithms for segmenting retinal blood vessels, based on different image processing
techniques, are described and their strengths and weaknesses
are compared. A hybrid algorithm that combines the confidence
outputs of each basic algorithm is described. The performance
of each algorithm was tested on the DRIVE dataset. Our hybrid
algorithm performs segmentation with similar precision and
sensitivity as a trained human observer.
